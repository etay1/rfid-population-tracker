# RFID Tracker
Developed during the Seneca One Hackathon @TechBuffalo

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for RFID Population Tracker came from the need to accurately track and manage the population within the Buffalo Museum. We wanted to provide valuable insights into visitor demographics, preferences for specific locations, and entrance/exit timestamps to enhance the overall museum experience.

## What it does

RFID Population Tracker is a software solution that utilizes RFID technology to track and manage the population within the museum. It collects real-time data on visitor movements, analyzes demographics, and provides valuable insights for museum administrators. The software records entrance and exit timestamps, identifies visitor preferences, and generates reports for data-driven decision-making.

## How we built it
We built RFID Population Tracker using a combination of RFID technology, data analytics, and user-friendly interfaces. The software incorporates RFID tags or cards for visitor identification and tracking. We developed a robust backend system to process and analyze the collected data, and a user-friendly frontend interface for administrators to access and utilize the insights.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development process, we faced challenges in optimizing the RFID tracking system to ensure accurate and reliable data collection. We also had to overcome technical hurdles in integrating the backend and frontend components seamlessly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have created RFID Population Tracker, a software solution that effectively tracks and manages the museum's population while providing valuable insights. Our accomplishment lies in developing a system that accurately captures entrance and exit timestamps, identifies visitor demographics, and helps optimize the museum's operations based on data-driven decision-making.

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we gained a deep understanding of RFID technology and its applications in population tracking. We also learned how to integrate complex systems and technologies to create a user-friendly and efficient software solution. Additionally, we enhanced our knowledge of data analytics and visualization techniques to present actionable insights to museum administrators.
